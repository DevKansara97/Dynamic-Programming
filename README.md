# Dynamic-Programming
This repository contains a collection of **Dynamic Programming (DP)** algorithms implemented in Java. It is designed for learning, reference, and practicing DP concepts.

## üìã Overview
Dynamic Programming is a powerful algorithmic paradigm used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem once, and storing the results for reuse. The main focus of this repository is to demonstrate key DP techniques through well-known examples.

## üìÅ Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- **Fibonacci**: Multiple implementations of Fibonacci sequence:
  - Recursive Approach
  - Memoization (Top-Down DP)
  - Tabulation (Bottom-Up DP)
  - Space-Optimized Solution

- **Other Algorithms** *(to be added)*:
  - Knapsack Problem
  - Longest Common Subsequence
  - Matrix Chain Multiplication
  - Subset Sum Problem
  - Coin Change Problem
